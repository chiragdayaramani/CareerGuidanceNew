# Shiksha - A Career Guide

Shiksha is a career guidance web app that takes input from user and suggests some future career opportunities.

## Abstract

Web Based Career Guidance is very important to our Educational System. We have an existing Manual Career Guidance System with human counselors in charge, but this system is plagued with the following problems: few number of human counselors, unavailability of a counselor in a good number of schools, few number of counselors attending to students during school hours and the office of a counselor in schools are so unpopular that students hardly meet them for career counseling. We have been able to design an Online Career Guidance Information System to solve the afore- mentioned problems. The Online Web Based Career Guidance system was designed and implemented using data collected from interviewing human counselors and various websites.


A Career Guidance System where students can see various career opportunities ,the system shows various fields available after 10th ,12th and after graduation. It also lists various colleges available where students can search colleges by their courses. Next the system allows users to give a test. It is actually a series of tests of various general questions. After test completion a score is calculated for each test. Based on those results the system manipulates and calculates the best career for that user. This result is then emailed to that user.
